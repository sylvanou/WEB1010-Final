#Final Exam

###Setup

1. Create a github repository called web1010final and clone that repo onto your computer.

2. Update your WEB1010 folder by issuing the 'git pull' command.

3. Copy all the files inside the final-exam directory in the WEB1010 directory and paste them inside the web1010final directory you just cloned from github.

###Part 1 - index.html

1. In the web1010final.html file, there is a form on the page which has a bug. It appears overlapping the "Learn More" button. Make sure this form is hidden when the page loads, either using css or javascript to hide it. (15pts)

2. Make it so that when the "Learn More" button is clicked, this button hides and the form (which was previously hidden) appears. (15pts)

3. Make it so that when the "Send me info!" button is clicked, the form posts asynchronously to the same endpoint used during the practice final (fvi-grad.com:4004/fakeform) (15pts)

4. Ensure the form posts correctly (form field names are correct). (15pts)

5. Make sure the form is posted with ajax and that the user gets some kind of visual feedback when the form submission button is clicked. for instance, the caption of the button can change to "sending..." upon click and then change to "Message Sent!" when the ajax response comes back. (15pts)

###Part 2 - js-exercises.js

1. Answer the questions in web1010final.js by typing your answers below the questions. Please put "Answer: " before each answer. (5pts per question, 15 questions)

2. When finished with both Part 1 and Part 2 of the exam, push your work to your web1010final remote on github, then submit the "Final Exam" assignment on Canvas.
